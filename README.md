# ObjectRelationalMapping

### What is an ORM?
Object-Relational Mapping is a technique for converting data between type systems in object-oriented programming languages. To simplify, it is a technique for converting classes and their data into data that can be used by other programs. Generally, though, when some mentions “an ORM,” they are discussing a library that uses this technique.
